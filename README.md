## Mscanalysis

Mscanalysis is a set of tools for determining characteristics of Audio and returning them to a user in a meaningful way.

## Install

Essentia tools are now bundled in the bin directory. You may need to install the following to function properly:

Copy the essentia files in bin to /usr/local/bin/ to ensure they get picked up properly.

```sudo apt-get install build-essential libyaml-dev libfftw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev python-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtag1-dev libchromaprint-dev python-six```

And make sure FFMPEG is installed too.

Run bundle to install necessary dependencies.

```
bundle install
```

### NOW with Sinatra powered API

Currently in dev

#### Setup database

```
rake db:migrate
```

Run the server

```
rerun 'ruby -Ilib application.rb'
```

### Current simple version

After you have spun up the server, you can visit ```http://localhost:4567/upload``` and upload an audio file.

To view all analyzed files go to ```http://localhost:4567/songs```

No full proper views yet.

### From command line - while Server is running

Make a request to the current song key endpoint

```
curl -v -F "data=@demo_files/02 - Antikue - Into Jomsom.wav" http://localhost:4567/song_key
```

### Use the script in IRB.

#### Get Song Key

Open ```get_song_key.rb``` Change @file to your chosen filename

Run:

```sh
ruby get_song_key.rb
```

The output will guess the key of the song.

#### Get Song Tempo

```ruby
@song = SongTempo.new '../demo_files/01 - Opening Sequence - Outside (Raining).mp3'
@song.tempo
@song.tempo_float
```

This will output the tempo of the song.
