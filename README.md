```

Run the server

```
rerun 'ruby -Ilib application.rb'
```

### Current simple version

After you have spun up the server, you can visit ```http://localhost:4567/upload``` and upload an audio file.

To view all analyzed files go to ```http://localhost:4567/songs```

No full proper views yet.

### From command line - while Server is running

Make a request to the current song key endpoint

```
curl -v -F "data=@demo_files/02 - Antikue - Into Jomsom.wav" http://localhost:4567/song_key
```

### Use the script in IRB.

#### Get Song Key

Open ```get_song_key.rb``` Change @file to your chosen filename

Run:

```sh
ruby get_song_key.rb
```

The output will guess the key of the song.

#### Get Song Tempo

```ruby
@song = SongTempo.new '../demo_files/01 - Opening Sequence - Outside (Raining).mp3'
@song.tempo
